# texed
Small linux (and POSIX?) program for text editing. Generates shared memory files on /dev/shm containing information about the curor and a text buffer, modifies the memory on those files directly. This way multiple clients can edit the same file simultaneously and work together seamlessly.

# goals
The program is a prototype with the sole purpose of testing out a software architecture idea. The input and output of the application _would_ work independently: managed by different processes, and potentially different programs; and concordantly: editing and displaying the same file with differently clients would work because there is a shared file format, so the correct interpretation of the data is ensured. This can easily be accomplished simultaneously for most user-space programs, concurrency isn't as big of an issue because most operations are fast enough that they'll be finished before than the user can start another one. From the outside this would look like a single application.

I consider at leas three advantages to this approach, first is flexibility: development of different modules can occur independently from each other, different teams with different goals could make their own versions of modules and have them all work together. The other two advantages apply only in the ideal scenario of a significant amount of user-space software being built in this manner. There would be consistent behavior among different applications, as the same module can be tweaked to interface with different formats, so the same input module can be used to manage user input in all applications (so, for example, configuration of that single module would apply to every application dependent on it). Last is resource usage, instead of having different applications implement (and run, on RAM!) the same functionality for each task, a single "master" module can be used to interface with each application.

# progress
So far I've made a library to manage these shared memory objects. A bunch of small command line programs modules to manage shared memory objects, and a monolithic big text editor that uses this library to create its buffers.
